The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d\&#39;Avinyó (Avinyó Street) in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso\&#39;s native Spain, giving them a savage aura. In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. The work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art. Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to wide anger and disagreement, even amongst his closest associates and friends.\r\nPainted in Paris during the summer of 1907, Picasso had created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work. He long acknowledged the importance of Spanish art and Iberian sculpture as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the art of Oceania, although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the Musée d\&#39;Ethnographie du Trocadéro (known today as Musée de l\&#39;Homme) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and was unconsciously influenced by African and Tribal art several months before completing Demoiselles. Some critics argue that the painting was a reaction to Henri Matisse\&#39;s Le bonheur de vivre and Blue Nude.&#39;, 1907, &#39;Cubism&#39;, 244, 234, 69, 837, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-30 07:36:06&#39;),</td>

Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter. It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work.\r\n\r\nConsidered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso\&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Still Life with Chair-caning&lt;/em&gt; (1911–1912) which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters \&quot;JOU\&quot;, which appear in many cubist paintings and refer to the newspaper titled Le Journal. Newspaper clippings were a common inclusion, physical pieces of newspaper, sheet music, and like items were also included in the collages. JOU may also at the same time be a pun on the French words jeu (game) or jouer (to play). Picasso and Braque had a friendly competition with each other and including the letters in their works may have been an extension of their game.&#39;, 1912, &#39;Cubism&#39;, 27, 35, 230, 317, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-04-16 17:51:09&#39;),</td>

Ingres\&#39; contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres\&#39; break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism.\r\nGrande Odalisque attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It has been especially noted for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is housed in the Louvre, Paris.\r\nThis eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had \&quot;neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation\&quot;.[3] This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism.[4] Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be criticized for his work until the mid-1820s.&#39;, 1814, &#39;Romanticism&#39;, 89, 163, 125, 103, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-19 18:47:17&#39;),</td>

A woman personifying Liberty leads the people forward over the bodies of the fallen, holding the tricolore flag of the French Revolution in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The painting is perhaps Delacroix\&#39;s best-known work.\r\nDelacroix depicted Liberty, as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people, an approach that contemporary critics denounced as \&quot;ignoble\&quot;. The mound of corpses acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789-94. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the romantic era.\r\nThe fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols (who may have been the inspiration for the character Gavroche in Victor Hugo\&#39;s Les Misérables). What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute tricolore can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre Dame.&#39;, 1830, &#39;Romanticism&#39;, 260, 325, 625, 350, 1, NULL, &#39;2015-12-31 18:27:02&#39;),</td>

It depicts a scene in the Folies Bergère nightclub in Paris.\r\nThe painting is filled with contemporaneous details specific to the Folies-Bergère. The distant pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner belong to a trapeze artist, who is performing above the restaurant\&#39;s patrons.\r\nThe beer which is depicted, Bass Pale Ale (noted by the red triangle on the label), would have catered not to the tastes of Parisians, but to those of English tourists, suggesting a British clientele. Manet has signed his name on the label of the bottle at the bottom left, combining the centuries-old practice of self-promotion in art with something more modern, bordering on the product placement concept of the late twentieth century. One interpretation of the painting has been that far from only being a seller of the wares shown on the counter, the woman is herself one of the wares for sale; conveying undertones of prostitution. The man in the background may be a potential client.\r\nBut for all its specificity to time and place, it is worth noting that, should the background of this painting indeed be a reflection in a mirror on the wall behind the bar as suggested by some critics, the woman in the reflection would appear directly behind the image of the woman facing forward. Neither are the bottles reflected accurately or in like quantity for it to be a reflection. These details were criticized in the French press when the painting was shown. The assumption is faulty when one considers that the postures of the two women, however, are quite different and the presence of the man to whom the second woman speaks marks the depth of the subject area. Indeed many critics view the faults in the reflection to be fundamental to the painting as they show a double reality and meaning to the work. One interpretation is that the reflection is an interaction earlier in time that results in the subject\&#39;s expression in the painting\&#39;s present.&#39;, 1882, &#39;Impressionism&#39;, 96, 130, 125, 300, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-05-22 17:26:20&#39;),</td>

In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat.

In his typical style, flat areas of color are outlined by thick black lines, and the figures are void of any shading or depth of color.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1888</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Post-Impressionism<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">74</span>, <span class="pl-c1">93</span>, <span class="pl-c1">230</span>, <span class="pl-c1">867</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-01-14 11:26:32<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

The Christ in the painting is a direct representation of a crucifix in Pont-Avon, France, where Gaugin visited to paint a number of times. It depicts a yellow form of Christ being crucified in 19th century northern France. French Breton women gather around the cross in prayer.

The painting was meant to be read from right to left, with the three main figures in the painting representing the three questions of the title.

He reworked the original as well as completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches. He would go and sit in the park and make numerous sketches of the various figures in order to perfect their form. He concentrated on the issues of colour, light, and form. \r\nMotivated by study in optical and colour theory, Seurat contrasted miniature dots of colors that, through optical unification, form a single hue in the viewer\&#39;s eye. He believed that this form of painting, now known as pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brush strokes. To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited today at the Art Institute of Chicago.\r\nIn creating the picture, Seurat employed the then-new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), most visibly for yellow highlights on the lawn in the painting, but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting\&#39;s completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown—a colour degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat\&#39;s lifetime.&#39;, 1884, &#39;Post-Impressionism&#39;, 208, 308, 425, 348, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-02 17:55:34&#39;),</td>

Painted during Cézanne\&#39;s final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size and in the number of players depicted. The series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne\&#39;s work during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a \&quot;prelude\&quot; to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.\r\nEach painting depicts Provençal peasants immersed in smoking their pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. Cézanne adapted a motif from 17th century Dutch and French genre painting which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone-faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting. Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama, Cézanne\&#39;s portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization. Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th century genre. A painting by one of the Le Nain brothers depicting card players at a museum in Aix-en-Provence, near the artist\&#39;s residence, is widely believed to have been an inspiration for Cézanne.&#39;, 1890, &#39;Post-Impressionism&#39;, 134, 182, 200, 388, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-04-01 04:59:50&#39;),</td>

The landscape in the background is the Oslofjord, viewed from the hill of Ekeberg, in Oslo (then Kristiania), Norway.\r\nEdvard Munch created several versions of Scream in various media. The Munch Museum holds one of two painted versions (1910, see gallery) and one pastel. The National Gallery of Norway holds the other painted version (1893, shown to right). A fourth version, in pastel, is owned by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen. Munch also created a lithograph of the image in 1895.\r\nScream has been the target of several high-profile art thefts. In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen. It was recovered several months later. In 2004, The Scream and Madonna were stolen from the Munch Museum. Both paintings were recovered in 2006. They had sustained some damage and went back on display in May 2008, after undergoing restoration.&#39;, 1893, &#39;Expressionism&#39;, 91, 74, 175, 446, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-19 08:14:08&#39;),</td>

Munch is an artist native to Norway and is widely known for his role in expressionistic art. Puberty has also been done as a lithograph and an etching by Munch.\r\nUpon observation of Puberty one of the strongest points in the piece to most is first the adolescent female who is placed mid-center of the painting. The second almost \&#39;haunting\&#39; point in this painting is the shadow the female is meant to be casting. It has been speculated, because of the current sexual mind Munch was in during the time in which he painted this, that the shadow may be a hovering male genital. The thought of male genitalia to a young woman during this time of her own rapidly changing body creates a stench of tension within the piece. Another thought on the shadow is that it suggests the symbolic meaning of death. Both of these speculations on the shadow in this piece reflect well upon what Munch is known for symbolically portraying in his artwork. The female in Puberty had originally been thought to have been a model of Munch\&#39;s while he was in Berlin. The strong detail used in the collar bones of her body suggests that he very well might have used a model. Either way this young lady is trapped in a space that alludes to much controversy within her mind and surroundings.&#39;, 1894, &#39;Expressionism&#39;, 152, 110, 125, 162, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-04-16 19:36:39&#39;),</td>

The three brothers, all of which appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. The principal sources for the story behind David\&#39;s Oath are the first book of Livy (sections 24-6) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities.

It is the third of three portraits of the Rivière family the artist painted that year. Caroline\&#39;s father, Philibert Rivière, was a successful court official under Napoleon\&#39;s empire, and sought to commemorate himself, his wife and daughter through a commission with the then young and rising artist - his portraits of Philibert and his wife are also still extant. Although Ingres favoured subject matter drawn from history or Greek legend, at this early stage in his career he earned his living mainly through commissions from wealthy patrons.[1] The family lived outside Paris, at St. Germain-en-Laye, and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière would have been between 13 and 15 at the time she was portrayed; according to Ingres the \&quot;ravishing daughter\&quot;.\r\nThe younger Rivière\&#39;s portrait describes slightly-built and youthful femininity and hints at a hesitant openness. The painting is rendered in bright hues and set against a serene white–blue early spring landscape, the freshness of which was intended to reflect the youth of the sitter. The background is not deeply portrayed; the perspective is shallow and rises—according to the art historian Robert Rosenblum—in \&quot;flattened horizontal tiers against which the figure seems crisply silhouetted as if in low relief.\&quot;\r\nTypical of portraits by Ingres of the time, Caroline Rivière is drawn with a disregard for anatomical accuracy. Her neck is overly elongated, and the bridge of her nose extends too far.Rivière is portrayed with a stiffness and awkwardness typical of her age, and shown in a manner which was intended to emphasise a sense of the nascent purity and simplicity of her youth. Yet the painting is generally seen in the light of pathos and tragedy, as the sitter died within a year of the work being completed&#39;, 1806, &#39;Romanticism&#39;, 100, 70, 230, 454, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-05-21 17:14:53&#39;),</td>

The sitter, Betty de Rothschild (1805-1886) had married banker James Mayer de Rothschild and was one of the wealthiest women in northern Europe, and one of the foremost Parisian patrons of the arts. Her beauty and elegance were widely known and celebrated, and inspired Heinrich Heine\&#39;s poem The Angel. For her portrait, Ingres sought to infuse symbols of her material wealth with the dignity, grace and beauty of Renaissance art, especially that of Raphael, while at the same time adhering to the command of line as practiced by Jan van Eyck. It is this combination which, according to art historians, places Ingres\&#39; so far apart from his early modernist contemporaries.\r\nBetty de Rothschild\&#39;s portrait is regarded as one of Ingres\&#39; most accomplished works, and has been described as \&quot;perhaps the most sumptuous yet approachable image of mid-nineteenth-century opulence.\&quot;&#39;, 1848, &#39;Romanticism&#39;, 142, 101, 350, 127, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-06 00:38:04&#39;),</td>

As a result, Degas kept it in his personal collection, where it remained until he left it to his dealer in 1913.

The composition, with a large amount of negative space, is thought by art historians to be based off of a photograph, which was an interest of Degas’ in his later life.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1875</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Impressionism<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">78</span>, <span class="pl-c1">118</span>, <span class="pl-c1">340</span>, <span class="pl-c1">514</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-03-30 00:47:59<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

Paul-Andre Lemoisne catalogued some ninety-one works in this category, spanning the period from 1860 to 1900--a number that did not include Degas\&#39;s equestrian waxes and bronzes--and they embrace a range of sizes and mediums. As with the Paris Opera, the spectacle of the turf gave Degas the base material from which to forge images of modern life in an alloy that fused references to the art of the past with details observed from life and scrupulously documented. But more than any other of his subjects, this was a genre that fed upon itself and spawned countless variations and adjustments. From a repertory established very early, Degas proceeded to select individual jockeys and rearrange them, to repeat poses and refine them, until this hermetic world lost all connection with the reality of the race track...\r\n\r\nThis diminutive composition of Race Horses, which falls toward the end of the first phase in this development, is immediately distinguished by its unusual support. It is pastel, and not oil, on panel: the wood here, possibly light mahogany, is the kind that might be used for cigar boxes. Although pastel on panel is not a unique combination, it is extremely rare in Degas\&#39;s oeuvre, and testifies to his continuing pleasure in experimenting with techniques and supports.&#39;, 1885, &#39;Impressionism&#39;, 30, 41, 45, 492, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-04-13 18:00:16&#39;),</td>

In Tahitian mythology the title may refer to either the girl imagining the ghost, or the ghost imagining her.\r\nThe subject of the painting was Gauguin\&#39;s Tahitian wife Tehura, then 14 years old, who one night, according to Gauguin, was lying in fear when he arrived late home: \&quot;immobile, naked, lying face downward on the bed with the eyes inordinately large with fear . . .

Emperor Napoleon III had initiated The Salon des Refusés after the Paris Salon rejected more than 4,000 paintings in 1863.\r\nThe painting\&#39;s juxtaposition of fully dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time, Manet\&#39;s composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi\&#39;s engraving of the Judgement of Paris (c. 1515) based on a drawing by Raphael.\r\nTwo additional works that are cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l\&#39;herbe are &lt;em&gt;Pastoral Concert&lt;/em&gt; (c. 1510, The Louvre) and &lt;em&gt;The Tempest&lt;/em&gt; (Gallerie dell\&#39;Accademia, Venice), both of which are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian. The Tempest is an enigmatic painting that features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and is breastfeeding a baby; the relationship between the two figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.&#39;, 1863, &#39;Impressionism&#39;, 214, 269, 225, 102, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-05-07 07:20:22&#39;),</td>

The work shows a woman in full figure standing on a wolf skin in front of a white curtain with a lily in her hand. The colour scheme of the painting is almost entirely white. The model is Joanna Heffernan, the artist\&#39;s mistress. Though the painting was originally called The White Girl, Whistler later started calling it Symphony in White, No. 1. By referring to his work in such abstract terms, he intended to emphasise his \&quot;art for art\&#39;s sake\&quot; philosophy.\r\nWhistler created the painting in the winter of 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet\&#39;s famous Déjeuner sur l\&#39;herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. &lt;em&gt;The White Girl&lt;/em&gt; shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact.

In the work, Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to Napoleon\&#39;s armies during the occupation of 1808.

Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, The Third of May 1808 marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era.

He began work on it in 1907 and it is the highpoint of his so-called \&#39;Golden Period\&#39;, when he painted a number of works in a similar style.

The painting is now in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum, in the Belvedere palace, in Vienna, Austria.\r\nWhen he painted The Kiss Klimt was 45 and still lived at home with his mother and two unmarried sisters - but behind the respectable facade he was a man with a ferocious sexual appetite. Klimt fathered at least three illegitimate children and probably many more. He was obsessed by women and he had a fixation with redheads. It is no surprise that the woman in The Kiss has red hair. According to writer Frank Whitford: \&quot;Together the man and the woman form the shape of a penis and I think that is intentional - it\&#39;s about sex and about the fulfillment of sex between a man and a woman.\&quot;&#39;, 1907, &#39;Art Nouveau&#39;, 180, 180, 230, 816, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-21 00:18:19&#39;),</td>

The painting is also reminiscent of Francisco Goya\&#39;s painting, &lt;em&gt;The Nude Maja&lt;/em&gt; (1800).\r\nManet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, \&quot;only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn\&quot; by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus\&#39; body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting\&#39;s lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting\&#39;s flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here, furthers the sexual tension of the piece.\r\nOlympia\&#39;s body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia\&#39;s \&quot;shamelessly flexed\&quot; left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian\&#39;s Venus.Likewise, the alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian\&#39;s portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.&#39;, 1863, &#39;Impressionism&#39;, 130, 190, 175, 357, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-01 12:27:30&#39;),</td>

Seurat borrowed from sources such as those of the fresco painters of the 15th century, the French classicism of Nicolas Poussin, and of contemporary Impressionism to create a unified canvas of a suburban, but placid Parisian riverside scene. The isolated figures and their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with the trees, and austere boundary walls and buildings, are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness.\r\nSeurat was twenty-four years old when he painted &lt;em&gt;Bathers at Asnières&lt;/em&gt;, and he was to live for just another seven years. The Bathers puzzled many of Seurat’s contemporaries, and the picture was not widely acclaimed during his lifetime. An appreciation of it grew, however, during the twentieth century, and today it hangs in the National Gallery, London, where it is considered one of the highlights of the gallery’s collection of paintings.&#39;, 1883, &#39;Post-Impressionism&#39;, 201, 300, 825, 83, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-14 19:28:33&#39;),</td>

Additionally, the right side of the tabletop is not in the same plane as the left side, as if the image simultaneously reflects two viewpoints.

The painting is the largest of a series of \&quot;Bather\&quot; paintings by Cézanne; the others are in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the National Gallery, London. Occasionally referred to as the Big Bathers or Large Bathers to distinguish it from the smaller works, the painting is considered one of the masterpieces of modern art, and is often considered Cézanne\&#39;s finest work. Cézanne worked on the painting for seven years, and it remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1906. The painting was purchased in 1937 for $110,000 with funds from a trust fund for the Philadelphia Museum of Art by their major benefactor Joseph E. Widener. It was previously owned by Leo Stein.\r\nThe abstract nude females present in &lt;em&gt;Large Bathers&lt;/em&gt; give the painting tension and density. It is exceptional among his work in symmetrical dimensions, with the adaption of the nude forms to the triangular pattern of the trees and river. Using the same technique as employed in painting landscapes and still lifes, &lt;em&gt;Large Bathers&lt;/em&gt; is reminiscent of the work of Titian and Peter Paul Rubens. Comparisons are also often made with the other famous group of nude women of the same period, Picasso\&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Les Demoiselles d\&#39;Avignon&lt;/em&gt;.&#39;, 1899, &#39;Post-Impressionism&#39;, 208, 249, 300, 140, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-03-26 03:31:37&#39;),</td>

Before the opening of the Salon, the French Revolution had begun. The National Assembly had been established, and the Bastille had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David’s portrait of Lavoisier, who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons. When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus\&#39;s sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Thus, Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. On the right, the Mother holds her two daughters, and the servant is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on a klismos on the left, alone, brooding, but knowing what he did was best for his country. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France.\r\nNote Brutus\&#39; tense, crossed feet in the picture, the sharp scissors that lay dead in the center of the painting, and the use of light and dark to draw a distinction between Brutus and his wife. Brutus does not even look back as his headless sons are brought into the room.&#39;, 1789, &#39;Romanticism&#39;, 323, 422, 650, 840, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-14 09:33:08&#39;),</td>

So, finding an entire family that agreed to sit for paintings, in fact for several sittings each was a bounty.\r\nJoseph Roulin became a particularly good, loyal and supporting friend to Van Gogh during his stay in Arles. To represent a man he truly admired was important to him. The family, with children ranging in age from four months to seventeen years, also gave him the opportunity to produces works of individuals in several different stages of life.\r\nRather than making photographic-like works, Van Gogh used his imagination, colors and themes artistically and creatively to evoke desired emotions from the audience.&#39;, 1888, &#39;Post-Impressionism&#39;, 81, 65, 350, 861, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-05-29 18:22:14&#39;),</td>

As the story goes, while Danae was imprisoned by her father, she was visited by Zeus, in the form of the golden rain flowing between her legs.

Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer favored the arts, especially Klimt, and commissioned him to complete another portrait of his wife Adele in 1912. Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 dollars, which is said to be the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York.&#39;, 1907, &#39;Art Nouveau&#39;, 138, 138, 3500, 390, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-04-03 21:33:40&#39;),</td>

The painting illustrates a rider cloaked in blue, speeding through a greenish meadow. The painting’s intentional abstractness had led many art theorists to project their own representations onto the figure, some seeing a child in the arms of the blue rider. Allowing viewers to participate in the representations of the art was a technique that Kandinsky would use to great fruition in his many later works, which became more and more abstract as his career wore on.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1903</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider)<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">55</span>, <span class="pl-c1">65</span>, <span class="pl-c1">180</span>, <span class="pl-c1">439</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-05-10 19:21:54<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

In this painting the many dimensions of the color white is used to represent the many possibilities and opportunities available in life. The color black, on the other hand, represents non-existence and death. Kandinsky expressed the color black as the silence of death, and in this painting, the black cuts through the white background with a riotous effect, shattering the peace of the colorful combination of colors, or as it were, opportunities in life.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1923</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Bauhaus<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">105</span>, <span class="pl-c1">98</span>, <span class="pl-c1">300</span>, <span class="pl-c1">900</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-01-30 00:44:41<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

This painting was one of his last major commissions, and is considered to be one of his masterpieces.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1428</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Renaissance<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">667</span>, <span class="pl-c1">317</span>, <span class="pl-c1">800</span>, <span class="pl-c1">762</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-04-26 09:21:36<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

The painting is the central panel of the Pisa Altarpiece, a large multi-paneled altarpiece executed for the chapel of St. Julian, owned by the notary Giuliano di Colino in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Pisa. The painting is in a very damaged state, the altarpiece having been cut up and sold in pieces long ago. Today the panel is smaller than its original state; it has lost perhaps as much as 8 cm. at the bottom and 2-2.5 cm. at each side. Eleven surviving panels of the altarpiece, which is the only documented work by Masaccio, are in various museums.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1426</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Renaissance<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">136</span>, <span class="pl-c1">73</span>, <span class="pl-c1">650</span>, <span class="pl-c1">613</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-04-13 06:23:04<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

A fourth blows a small conch shell in his ear in an effort to wake him. The scene is set in a forest, and the background shows, in the distance, the sea from which Venus emerged.

The Adoration of the Magi theme was popular in the Renaissance Florence. The work was commissioned by Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, a banker of humble origins and dubious morality connected to the House of Medici, for his chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella (now destroyed). In the scene are present numerous characters among which are several members of the Medici family: Cosimo de\&#39; Medici (the Magus kneeling in front of the Virgin, described by Vasari as \&quot;the finest of all that are now extant for its life and vigour\&quot;), his sons Piero (the second Magus kneeling in the centre with the red mantle) and Giovanni (the third Magus), and his grandsons Giuliano and Lorenzo. The three Medici portrayed as Magi were all dead at the time the picture was painted, and Florence was effectively ruled by Lorenzo.&#39;, 1475, &#39;Renaissance&#39;, 111, 134, 800, 617, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-03 23:43:47&#39;),</td>

The paintings are both nearly 2 metres (over 6 feet) high and are painted in oils. Both were painted on wooden panel; that in the Louvre has been transferred to canvas. Both paintings show the Madonna and Christ Child with the infant John the Baptist and an angel, in a rocky setting which gives the paintings their usual name. The significant compositional differences are in the gaze and right hand of the angel. There are many minor ways in which the works differ, including the colours, the lighting, the flora, and the way in which sfumato has been used. Although the date of an associated commission is documented, the complete histories of the two paintings are unknown, and lead to speculation about which of the two is earlier.&#39;, 1505, &#39;Renaissance&#39;, 190, 120, 600, 232, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-12 01:55:31&#39;),</td>

It is traditionally thought to illustrate the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God breathes life into Adam, the first man. Chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis on the Sistine ceiling, it was among the last to be completed. It is the most well-known of the Sistine Chapel fresco panels, and its fame as a piece of art is rivaled only by the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become one of the single most iconic images of humanity and has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Along with Leonardo da Vinci\&#39;s The Last Supper, The Creation of Adam and the other Sistine Chapel panels are the most replicated religious paintings of all time.&#39;, 1512, &#39;Renaissance&#39;, 480, 230, 1200, 900, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-11 04:59:23&#39;),</td>

The portrait is one of a pair that depict a recently married merchant and his wife. Agnolo Doni married Maddalena Strozzi in 1503, but Raphael\&#39;s portraits were probably executed in 1506, the period in which the painter studied the art of Leonardo da Vinci most closely. The composition of the portraits resembles that of the Mona Lisa: the figures are presented in the same way in respect to the picture plane, and their hands, like those of the Mona Lisa, are placed on top of one another. But the low horizon of the landscape background permits a careful assessment of the human figure by providing a uniform light which defines surfaces and volumes. This relationship between landscape and figure presents a clear contrast to the striking settings of Leonardo, which communicate the threatening presence of nature.&#39;, 1506, &#39;Renaissance&#39;, 63, 45, 400, 274, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-09 02:29:58&#39;),</td>

A 10-year restoration process was completed in 2008, after which the painting was returned to its home at the Uffizi in Florence. In this painting, as in most of the Madonnas of his Florentine period, Raphael arranged the three figures - Mary, Christ and the young John the Baptist - to fit into a geometrical design. Though the positions of the three bodies are natural, together they form an almost regular triangle. The Madonna is shown young and beautiful, as with Raphael’s various other Madonnas. She is also clothed in red and blue, also typical, for red signifies the passion of Christ and blue was used to signify the church. Christ and John are still very young, only babies. John holds a goldfinch in his hand, and Christ is reaching out to touch it. The background is one typical of Raphael.

The future Charles II rests his hand on the head of an enormous mastiff. The mastiff had been a guard dog since Roman times and appears here as a protector for the royal children at a time of civil unrest. Nonetheless, the position of the young Prince\&#39;s hand suggests that he is capable of ruling this powerful beast and, by implication, his country. The original of this group portrait was painted for Charles I in 1637, and is still in the Royal Collection. It shows the children at full length with two dogs, the mastiff depicted here and a small \&#39;King Charles\&#39; spaniel at the right. Along with Van Dyck\&#39;s earlier picture of the three eldest children, it was an immensely popular composition, and was copied many times.

The work\&#39;s complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.&#39;, 1656, &#39;Baroque&#39;, 318, 276, 1100, 706, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-03-23 14:18:29&#39;),</td>

The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l\&#39;oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.&#39;, 1666, &#39;Baroque&#39;, 44, 38, 750, 673, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-01-17 13:01:58&#39;),</td>

The work shows an apocrypha scene from the Old Testament Book of Judith which details the delivery of Israel from the Assyrian general Holofernes. In this scene, Judith and her maidservant behead the general after he has fallen asleep drunk. The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide spurts of blood to the energy of the two women as they try to wield the large dagger. The effort of the women\&#39;s struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Although the painting depicts a classic scene from the Bible, Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor Agostino Tassi, who was tried in court for her rape, as Holofernes.&#39;, 1611, &#39;Baroque&#39;, 159, 126, 700, 567, 1, NULL, &#39;2016-02-22 18:34:49&#39;),</td>

It is considered one of the more original and complex paintings in Western art because of the iconography, the unusual geometric orthogonal perspective, the use of the mirror to reflect the space, and that the portrait is considered unique by some art historians as the record of a marriage contract in the form of a painting.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1434</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Northern Renaissance<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">82</span>, <span class="pl-c1">62</span>, <span class="pl-c1">900</span>, <span class="pl-c1">247</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-01-09 05:27:24<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

One of his most famous works, it is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy and is considered one of the preeminent examples of Mannerist portraiture. The painting depicts Eleanor of Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de<span class="pl-cce">\&#39;</span> Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, sitting with her hand resting on the shoulder of one of her sons. This gesture, as well as the pomegranate motif on her dress, referred to her role as mother. Eleanor wears a heavily brocaded dress with black arabesques. In this pose, she is depicted as the ideal woman of the Renaissance.<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">1545</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>Mannerism<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">115</span>, <span class="pl-c1">96</span>, <span class="pl-c1">675</span>, <span class="pl-c1">58</span>, <span class="pl-c1">1</span>, <span class="pl-k">NULL</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span>2016-03-11 21:13:08<span class="pl-pds">&#39;</span></span>),</td>

An exceptionally large painting, it is very clearly divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality.
